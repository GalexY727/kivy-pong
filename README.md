This is a simple pong game made using kivy's python library so that I can hopefully make more UIs in the future because I don't want to jump straight to web apps and electron ðŸ˜…

Steps to run:

https://github.com/GalexY727/kivy-pong/assets/65139378/af1499cb-ad6d-4101-8c8f-b5aa5818e8ba

There are two options to run this program:
### 1: Running the executable:
Launch the .exe inside of ./dist/, and you should be good to go!
### 2: Manual installation
```
git clone <repository>
pip install requirements.txt
python main.py
```
